# Hey, I’m JustAdreamerFL 👋

- 🏫 Student at FEIT Žilina
- 💙 Flutter dev (plus a mix of other things you can snoop in my repos)
- ⚽ Football lover, proud pirate at heart 🏴‍☠️, big fan of showers 🚿, and forever juiced for juice 🧃
- 🎨 I prefer native styles and apps (or beers) with a local touch — anything that feels made for the place
- 🔒 No social links here — just code, vibes, and the occasional inside joke
- 🌟 Highlight: check out my "collage switch game" repo — it’s my favorite little chaos projevct xddd

I like localized stuff — whether that’s an app built with local language support or a neighbourhood brewery with a great story. If you peek through my repos you’ll see Flutter is my main tool, but I tinker with other tech too.

Want this translated to Slovak, shortened, or turned into a README that auto-links your collage switch game repo? I’ve put together this draft — tell me which version you want next and I’ll prepare it.

f it - this is perfect 🌚
